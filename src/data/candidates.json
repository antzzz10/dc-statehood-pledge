As a citizen, I have been active in protests, demonstrations, and education about statehood. And as a Candidate for DC Delegate, I have begun building a strategy to win over leading Democrats, persuadable Republicans, and the people who influence both.",
        "intendedActions": "On Day One of every term, I will introduce a Statehood bill in the US House -- as Delegate Norton did. Then I will execute a carefully crafted strategy to win over key Democrats and persuadable Republicans, and I will undergird this strategy with a national marketing campaign to educate Americans everywhere about the injustice and outrage of DC's disenfranchisement. Truly, people don't know, or don't know why they should care.",

        "voterInvolvement": "We need our own education campaign -- too many residents even in DC don't really think about statehood. I'll tie that campaign to America's overall emergence from the Trump nightmare -- once he is gone, America must and WILL rededicate ourselves to the principles of democracy, and I will argue that DC Statehood should be the #1 gesture and symbol of that recommitment.",
        "additionalComments": "Let's be clear: if the Republicans thought THEY would get 2 new Senators from making DC a state, we'd have been a state for years. We have to call out this hypocrisy -- and at the same time, find avenues beyond shame (because they have so little); i.e., a grand bargain that gives us statehood and Republicans something they want. As Delegate I will work very hard to find that bargain."
